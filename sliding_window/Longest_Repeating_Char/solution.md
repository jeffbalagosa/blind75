### **Problem: Longest Repeating Character Replacement**

You are given a string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer `k`. You can replace up to `k` characters in the string to maximize the length of a substring containing only one distinct character.

---

### **Key Insights**
1. To maximize the length of a substring with one distinct character, focus on replacing the least frequent characters in the substring with the most frequent character.
2. Using a sliding window approach allows efficient adjustment of the substring boundaries.

---

### **Algorithms**

#### **1. Brute Force Solution**
- **Approach**:
  - Iterate over all possible substrings.
  - Count the frequency of characters in each substring.
  - Check if the substring can be transformed into a valid one by replacing at most `k` characters.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Time**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
  - **Space**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of unique characters.

**Python Code**:
```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            count = {}
            max_freq = 0
            for j in range(i, len(s)):
                count[s[j]] = count.get(s[j], 0) + 1
                max_freq = max(max_freq, count[s[j]])
                if (j - i + 1) - max_freq <= k:
                    res = max(res, j - i + 1)
        return res
```

---

#### **2. Sliding Window (Improved)**
- **Approach**:
  - Treat each unique character in the string as the "target" character.
  - Use a sliding window to check if replacing other characters with the target character requires at most `k` changes.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Time**: \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of unique characters in the string.
  - **Space**: \(O(1)\).

**Python Code**:
```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        unique_chars = set(s)

        for char in unique_chars:
            count = 0
            left = 0
            for right in range(len(s)):
                if s[right] == char:
                    count += 1
                while (right - left + 1) - count > k:
                    if s[left] == char:
                        count -= 1
                    left += 1
                res = max(res, right - left + 1)
        return res
```

---

#### **3. Sliding Window (Optimal)**
- **Approach**:
  - Maintain a sliding window with a frequency count of characters.
  - Keep track of the most frequent character in the window (`max_freq`).
  - Adjust the window size to ensure the remaining characters can be replaced within the limit of `k`.
- **Complexity**:
  - **Time**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
  - **Space**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of unique characters.

**Python Code**:
```python
class Solution:
    def characterReplacement(self, s: str, k: int) -> int:
        count = {}
        max_length = 0
        max_freq = 0
        left = 0

        for right in range(len(s)):
            count[s[right]] = count.get(s[right], 0) + 1
            max_freq = max(max_freq, count[s[right]])

            while (right - left + 1) - max_freq > k:
                count[s[left]] -= 1
                left += 1

            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

        return max_length
```

### **Complexity Comparison**
| Method                | Time Complexity  | Space Complexity |
|-----------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Brute Force           | \(O(n^2)\)       | \(O(m)\)         |
| Sliding Window        | \(O(m \times n)\)| \(O(1)\)         |
| Optimal Sliding Window| \(O(n)\)         | \(O(m)\)         |

### **Recommended Solution**
- Use the **Optimal Sliding Window** approach for its linear time complexity and efficient use of space. It balances simplicity and performance for this problem.
